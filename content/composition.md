### Free In My Head

{{< video id="-93rYWBapRI" title="Free In My Head">}}

Hail numbs my face,  
Hail numbs my hands  
I’m behind my minds gates  
Too far away to care.

I lost my way,  
I try other ways  
I’m behind my minds gates  
Too far away to care.

Knights spies and rock stars walk in my mind,  
Stories intertwine tie and untie  
Knights spies and rock stars walk in my mind,  
Knights, spies, rock stars

I feel free to dance inside my head,  
I feel free to dance inside my head,  
I feel free to dance inside my head,  
I feel so free!

They talk to me  
I bite my lips  
To stop my melody,  
So that they cannot see…

Knights spies and rock stars walk in my mind,  
Stories intertwine tie and untie  
Knights spies and rock stars walk in my mind,  
Knights, spies, rock stars

I feel free to dance inside my head,  
I feel free to dance inside my head,  
I feel free to dance inside my head,  
I feel so free!  
I feel so free!

Yes, I’m not free  
To dance in my life  
But, meanwhile

Knights spies and rock stars walk in my mind,  
Stories intertwine tie and untie  
Knights spies and rock stars walk in my mind,
Knights, spies, rock stars

I feel free to dance inside my head,  
I feel free to dance inside my head,  
I feel free to dance inside my head,  
I feel so free!  
I feel so free!  
I feel so free!

### Grey

I’ve overslept again Just like yesterday  
And like everyday  
thanks to adrenaline, sugar and caffeine.  
my thoughts are silenced during my routine  
but between train stations I lose my illusions  
I have stopped trying  
I've no more ambitions  
To be blue or be back in the pink It’s ok if the gray goes away  
I just need some colors  
Maybe I’m not free Maybe I feel lonely But my fridge is full I choose safety  
At work, not to displease I hide my true beliefs,  
I join the crowd of shadows without faces  
To be blue or be back in the pink It’s ok if the gray goes away  
I just need some colors  
Stuck in a world of gray Pay to live, live to pay Throw time to the drain Hopes have gone astray  
It’s gonna choke me out It make me want to shout Tears flows, it’s too late Blue leave me no way out  
I’m swept away by waves Blue take me to the depth I think I’m drowning  
But deep down I find light  
To be blue or be back in the pink It’s ok if the gray goes away  
I just need some colors  
To live  
To be blue or be back in the pink It’s ok if the gray goes away  
I just need some colors  
To live, To live

### Baby To Rock

She wants me to give her  
A baby to rock  
From the bibs to the cribs  
She planned everything  
‘cause she’s hoping someday  
I might change my mind

And the dust covers the cradles  
Ans she is still waiting

She pray for an angel  
Smiling and caring  
Came to fight her demons  
With misspelled loves notes  
Once she thought I’d save her  
I thought that I could

And the dust covers the cradles  
And she is still waiting

She wants a child to rock  
To be someone’s world  
She can’t see that she is  
The center of mine,  
She can’t see, that she is  
The center of mine,  
The center of my world.

### What Should I do Now?

In the night I hear your laugh  
You’re smoking on the threshold  
Your laugher mingles with mine  
It shines like a guiding light  
In a hall of mirrors

You are light years away from me  
Can I fix myself without you?

I want to dance with you without sense  
What should I do now?  
What should I do now?  
Hopeless I dance alone alone without sense  
I dance to forget  
I dance to forget  
I juste want TO DANCE WITH YOU WIthOUt SENSE  
What should I do now?  
What should I do now?  
What should I do Now?

On the phone I hear your laugh  
And it sound like a new start  
Now that you are free to shine  
Everything will be alright  
I can’t wait to see you

You are light years away from me  
Can I fix myself without you?

I want to dance with you without sense  
What should I do now?  
What should I do now?  
Hopless I dance alone alone without sense  
I dance to forget  
I dance to forget  
I juste want TO DANCE WITH YOU WIthOUt SENSE  
What should I do now?  
What should I do now?  
What should I do Now?

Now Sometimes I hear your laugh  
Or i find you in my voice  
And i break into a smile  
Even if it’s bitter sweet  
‘Cause only memories….
